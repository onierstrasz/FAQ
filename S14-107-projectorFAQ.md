Clickshare CSE-200

input A = VGA; B = Clickshare; C = HDMI

NB: sound only works with clickshare and HDMI

Use the USB clickshare dongle (in the SCG safe in room 105) to connect a laptop (up to 2 at a time).

On a mobile device connect with wireless to the clickshare wifi (password = "clickshare").
Then either use the clickshare app (for photos etc), or on an iOS device connect with airplay to mirror.
