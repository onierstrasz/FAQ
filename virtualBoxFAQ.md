## Another one:

I was able to fix the UEFI problems as follows (credit to VirtualBox forum):

At UEFI prompt: Type exit
You'll be brought into an EFI text-mode GUI.
Select Boot Maintenance Manager and click.
Select Boot From File and click
You should see two entries in a list (they are cryptic looking PCI bus paths).

The first PCI path in the list is probably the boot partition that doesn't contain bootable firmware. The second PCI path is probably to the recovery partition, the one you need to boot from. If the 2nd partition isn't the recovery partition, look under the paths in the list to see if one of them is it. If the recovery partition isn't present and valid, these instructions won't work.

Click the 2nd entry, you should see (and then click):

macOS Install Data

Then click:

Locked Files

Then (if present), click

Boot Files

And finally click:

boot.efi

Installation will continue, or you will boot into the OS or get the Recovery Utilities menu (where macOS can be reinstalled from or Disk Utilities run). The ambiguity of that last statement is I did that awhile before writing this comment and I don't recall what I booted into first, only that it worked and was not hard to figure out what to do at that point. If you have a recovery partition, to boot directly into the Recovery Mode turn on the Mac and immediately press and hold (âŒ˜)-R

Boot by clicking "Start".
When it boots, you will see some data being displayed.
This part needs clarification - UEFI Interactive Shell loads, but nothing happens. 

If you use the command "exit" you can shift to the EFI menu, but changing the settings doesn't seem to affect the progress of the UEFI Interactive Shell, which stops at the Shell> prompt.

After a while, you will need to choose the language for installation. Choose your own language.

**I never get past the Shell prompt**

Then you will be asked where to install macOS.
On the upper-left corner, you will see a "Utilities" button. Click it and select "Disk Utility".
You will see a window with different storages on the left. Choose "VBOX HARDDISK Media". Note: You may have to select View/View All Devices
Erase the Storage by clicking the "Erase" button on the top.
You will be prompted to enter the name for the storage. Enter your desired name and continue.
Wait for the process to complete. Then quit Disk Utility.
You will find a new storage media, which is like a hard disk. Choose that storage for the installation of OS X to install.
After installation completes, the virtual machine will automatically shut down. Go to "Settings".
Go to the "Storage" section to eject the .iso file.
Boot virtual machine again.
Choose system language.
Choose allow location or not.
You will be asked to enter your Apple ID. Even if you have an Apple ID, do not enter now.
Accept EULA of macOS.
Restore Time Machine Backups (if you have)
You will see the main page of OS X, open App Store.
Enter your Apple ID and sign in...
