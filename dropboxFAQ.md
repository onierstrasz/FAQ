* Q What to do when Dropbox crashes?

2023-11-30 Dropbox failed to start with the error “"No valid file provider found with identifier ‘com.getdropbox.dropbox.fileprovider/06d02d11-9c4e-467a-bd1f-3dbaa7005eaf’."”

I reinstalled Dropbox, which did not help.
Then I did an “Advanced reinstall”: https://help.dropbox.com/installs/advanced-reinstall

Dropbox would start but would get stuck syncing files.
Also the syncing preferences gave the warning: “You are not eligible for the update Dropbox for macOS on File Provider at this time. Your Dropbox folder contains some file types that are not supported.”

Finally I did another advanced reinstall, and hid the old Dropbox folder before starting it again. This worked.
